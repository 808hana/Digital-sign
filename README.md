About the app
This app allows you to digitaly sign text documents using private and shared key, which can be generated in the app. Also you can check someone elses digital sign. To check digital sign of someone else (or you own), you need public and shared key. If the digital sign is legitimate, the app will show that it is a MATCH. Otherwise, for cosmetic purposes, it will show NO MATCH.
If you are a bit lost, donÂ´t worry, the app contains instructions in GUI :)
